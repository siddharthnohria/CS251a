\noindent
This is a scatter plot of time taken for execution v/s Number of elements when the number of threads created is 1. \\
X-axis holds the number of elements {1000,10000,100000,1000000} and Y-axis displays the time taken correspondingly.

\caption{2 Threads}
\label{fig:Scatter2 graph}
\end{figure}
\noindent
This is a scatter plot of time taken for execution v/s Number of elements when the number of threads created is 2. \\
X-axis holds the number of elements {1000,10000,100000,1000000} and Y-axis displays the time taken correspondingly.

\caption{4 Threads}
\label{fig:Scatter3 graph}
\end{figure}
\noindent
This is a scatter plot of time taken for execution v/s Number of elements when the number of threads created is 4. \\
X-axis holds the number of elements {1000,10000,100000,1000000} and Y-axis displays the time taken correspondingly.

\caption{8 Threads}
\label{fig:Scatter4 graph}
\end{figure}
\noindent
This is a scatter plot of time taken for execution v/s Number of elements when the number of threads created is 8. \\
X-axis holds the number of elements {1000,10000,100000,1000000} and Y-axis displays the time taken correspondingly.

\caption{16 Threads}
\label{fig:Scatter5 graph}
\end{figure}
\noindent
This is a scatter plot of time taken for execution v/s Number of elements when the number of threads created is 16. \\
X-axis holds the number of elements {1000,10000,100000,1000000} and Y-axis displays the time taken correspondingly.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{averageplot.eps}
\caption{linegraph}
\label{fig:avg graph}
\end{figure}
\noindent
This is a line graph of average time taken for execution v/s Number of elements. \\
X-axis holds the number of elements {1000,10000,100000,1000000} and Y-axis displays the time taken correspondingly. \\
Different lines represent different no. of threads {1,2,4,8,16}.

\caption{Bargraph}
\label{fig:Scatter graph}
\end{figure}
\noindent
This is a bar graph of average speed for execution w.r.t to the case with 1 thread v/s Number of elements. \\
X-axis holds the number of elements {1000,10000,100000,1000000} and number of threads {1,2,4,8,16} and Y-axis displays the ratio w.r.t 1 thread.

\caption{bargraph variance}
\label{fig:Scatter graph}
\end{figure}
\noindent
This is a bar graph of variance in speed of execution w.r.t to the case with 1 thread v/s Number of elements. \\
X-axis holds the number of elements {1000,10000,100000,1000000} and number of threads {1,2,4,8,16} and Y-axis displays the ratio(speed) w.r.t 1 thread and also its variance.
